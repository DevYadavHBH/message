    <li>You taught me to appreciate the present more</li>
    <li>You made me realise worlds not so bad and also bad</li>
    <li>I learned humour from you a little bit, i learned where the line lies in humour</li>
    <li>I became less introverted because of you</li>
    <li>i leanred to handle my mistakes,my past,my feelings</li>
    <li>I learned to trust right kind of people</li>
    <li>You gave me good friends, i love our friend circle now</li>
    <li>You taught me how fun it can be to hang out with firends</li>
    <li>AND you made me <strong>happy</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The present</h2>
